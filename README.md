## Summary

For our project, we plan on optimizing and analyzing the performance of the Hough Transform
algorithm – an algorithm commonly used for line and shape detection in computer vision – using
AVX compiler intrinsics, OpenMP and OpenMPI against the OpenCV implementation on a
x86-64 CPU.

## Background

The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique that is primarily used in image analysis
and digital image processing. It is a popular technique to detect any shape that can be represented
mathematically. This algorithm has been widely used for straight line detection in low resolution
images and still images but suffers from execution time and resource requirements. While this
algorithm is an effective method to detect lines in an image, the Hough Transform is known to be
notoriously slow and is not used for real-time applications.
